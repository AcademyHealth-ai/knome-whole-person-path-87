# Custom Swift Placeholder

This folder contains minimal Swift files you can zip and upload to the "Custom Swift" section.

How to create the ZIP (Chromebook):
- Open the Files app, right‑click the `custom-swift` folder, and choose "Zip selection".
- Upload the resulting `.zip` (ensure the top level contains `.swift` files, not a nested folder).

Files included:
- `Placeholder.swift` — simple class with a no‑op method.
- `NativeBridge.swift` — Objective‑C compatible class with a `ping()` method.
